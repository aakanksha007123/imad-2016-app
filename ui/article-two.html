         <p>Computer science
AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered a part of AI. (See AI effect). According to Russell & Norvig (2003, p. 15), all of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories: time sharing, interactive interpreters, graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse, rapid development environments, the linked list data structure, automatic storage management, symbolic programming, functional programming, dynamic programming and object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Finance
    Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation.

Use of AI in banking can be tracked back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in USA set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards. Apps like Kasisito and Moneystream are using AI in financial services

Banks use artificial intelligence systems to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. For example, Kensho is a computer system that is used to analyze how well portfolios perform and predict changes in the market. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place. In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition.
Also, systems are being developed, like Arria, to translate complex data into simple and personable language.
There are also wallets, like Wallet.AI that monitor an individual's spending habits and provides ways to improve them.

AI has also reduced fraud and crime by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any changes or anomalies.</p>
